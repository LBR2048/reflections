What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, git creates a hidden directory that will be used to keep track of all changes in the files contained in the containing directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is good for me to visualize what I want to do before commiting the changes for real.
