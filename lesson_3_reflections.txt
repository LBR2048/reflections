When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working from differente computers or when there are several developers working on the same project


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes I may want to finish my work on a particular commit before pulling and merging changes made by other developers
